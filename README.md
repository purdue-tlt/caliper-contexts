IMS Global caliper-contexts
================

caliper-contexts provides a JSON-LD remote context that provides a dereferenceable mapping of Caliper terms to IRIs.  The Caliper Context document also links object properties to concepts derived from well-known ontologies such as FOAF, W3C Open Annotation, W3C Organization and schema.org.

## Documentation

See the JSON-LD specification for more information on the JSON-LD concept of the Context: http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-context
